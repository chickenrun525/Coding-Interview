Each Edge has three components important to Facebook’s algorithm:

First, there’s an affinity score between the viewing user and the item’s creator — 
if you send your friend a lot of Facebook messages and check their profile often, 
then you’ll have a higher affinity score for that user than you would, say, an old acquaintance you haven’t spoken to in years.
Second, there’s a weight given to each type of Edge. 
A comment probably has more importance than a Like, for example.
And finally there’s the most obvious factor — time. The older an Edge is, the less important it becomes.
Multiply these factors for each Edge then add the Edge scores up and you have an Object’s EdgeRank.
